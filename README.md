# ~/

These are the files I use for setting up my environment. They are copied heavily from @tarebyte who got them from someone else.
I've since diverged enough to really warrant a fork. Some of this is specific to my job at Shopify.
Although the original is platform agnostic, currently this may lean a little towards OSX.

## Install
3 Easy steps:

```
git clone https://github.com/patrickdonovan/dotfile ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles

script/bootstrap
```

And that's it! This will symlink any .symlink file into your home directory
